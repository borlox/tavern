tavern scripting API
====================
This document describes the Lua scripting API for the tavern game.
Allthough Lua has a dynamic type system, the types of variables or function
arguments and return values are given in the form `<TypeName>`. All types are
described in detail in the Types sectiong.


Global variables
----------------

### <World> World
This variable represents the game world with all the maps and the hero unit.

Global functions
----------------

### Log(<LogLevel> level, <string> text)
Add a message to the log file, if logging for the given level is enabled.

### SetEventHandler(<function> handler)
Set the handler function for events. For any event, the function given to
`SetEventHandler` is called. The function arguments are

```handler(<string> event, ...)```

where `...` are a variable number of event parameters.

### SetUpdateHandler(<function> handler)
Set the handler function for frame updates. This handler is called on every 
frame drawn. Its argument is the elapsed time in seconds:

```handler(<float> elapsed)```

**Note**: As this function is called very frequently, it should not do too much
work to be as fast as possible. 

### <Texture> LoadTexture(<string> filename)
Load and return a texture from a file.

### <Map> GetCurrentMap()
Return the current map.
